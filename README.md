I hope to learn more about machine learning and data analytics/visualization through VAIL. Additionally, I hope to gain more exposure to different industries, job pathways, and learn from speakers. Above all, I hope to connect with a network of like-minded students and inspiring mentors!

1. Supervised learning is when a computer is able to create a function h(x) based on training data; then, it uses that function on another set of data. On the other hand, unsupervised learning is when a computer must find patterns and correlations on its own using a particular set of data.
2. The statement "Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries" is FALSE. Scikit-Learn is built on top of these common data and math libraries.

1. Tensors are a mathematical representation of a physical entity that may be characterized by magnitude and multiple directions.
2. When you compile in TensorFlow, you define a loss function, an optimizer, and a metric.

Problem: Recently, numerous studies have shown that AI and ML models have higher accuracy at diagnosing patients than doctors. However, there need to be specific algorithms
and models developed for each condition/disease/etc. and their respective diagnostic tools which is extremely time consuming.
Solution: We should develop a solution that can help those in the healthcare industry with diagnoses by creating our own deep learning algorithm. Specifically, we want to develop a CNN that can correctly classify x-rays of patients with pneumonia. We chose a CNN because they are strong at image recognition and is ideal for processing 2D images.

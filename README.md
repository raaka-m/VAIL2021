I hope to learn more about machine learning and data analytics/visualization through VAIL. Additionally, I hope to gain more exposure to different industries, job pathways, and learn from speakers. Above all, I hope to connect with a network of like-minded students and inspiring mentors!

1. Supervised learning is when a computer is able to create a function h(x) based on training data; then, it uses that function on another set of data. On the other hand, unsupervised learning is when a computer must find patterns and correlations on its own using a particular set of data.
2. The statement "Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries" is FALSE. Scikit-Learn is built on top of these common data and math libraries.
